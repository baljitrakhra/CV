**I am breaking the barriers.**

I am a recent graduate of one of the most discerning dev bootcamps in the world, backed by a 16-year user-facing career. I moved from a lucrative, “safe” career in department for international trade to realise a lifelong dream to pursue a career in software development.

I am professionally trained in agile development, pair programming, and test-driven development (TDD).  I am well suited to immediately contribute to front-end and back-end development. I am proficient on object-oriented design and programming. Most importantly, I am confident in my ability to quickly learn any new technology.

I am eager to leverage my application project management and design acumen while evolving my new development skills. The next step in my evolution is to join an innovative team of brilliant developers to which I can apply my new knowledge of web development while learning all I can as quickly as I can.

### <a name="skills">Skills</a>
##### Application Design and Project Management
I have 15 years’ experience in application design and management of projects requiring deep and ongoing engagement with customers and stakeholders. My role typically was that of Solution Architect in which I acted as a shepherd of the customer's requirements through development, test, and training.

I have broad experience managing multi-year projects, from strategic planning throughout development, deployment, support, and training.

##### Knowledge Acquisition & Training
The number one skill that my cohort agrees that I possess is an ability to quickly sort through complex technologies to learn the key aspects and then convey this new knowledge to my teammates.

I have regularly led training sessions in which I taught complex technical subjects to non-technical users.

##### Facilitation and Public Speaking
Every role in my professional experience required leadership of joint-application design sessions with C-level executives and end-users.  This role required conflict resolution and facilitation of large, opinionated conversations.

##### Solution Design and Analysis
I have a sixth sense for identifying bottlenecks and validating/assessing solutions. I also have a keen ability to develop technical solutions to business problems.

##### <a name="projects">Development Projects</a>
Before Makers I could create the simplest of web pages with HTML and CSS. Today I can create full stack applications using technologies such as Ruby on Rails, Javascript and AngularJS (see my contribution to [**Leave**](https://github.com/shaneoston72/smartAlarm-mobile)).  Before Makers Academy I could not tell you about RESTful APIs let alone create one. After Makers Academy I can create one and strap Angular and Ionic SPAs to it.

Here's a sampling of some the work I participated in at Makers Academy. Projects are listed in chronological order to demonstrate the increasing complexity of the work we did.
